'''Excellent! It looks like you're comfortable with basic expressions and comparators.

But what about extreme expressions and comparators?

Instructions
Let's run through the comparators again with more complex expressions. Set each variable to True or False depending on what you think the result will be.

Set bool_one to the result of (20 - 10) > 15
Set bool_two to the result of (10 + 17) == 3**16
Set bool_three to the result of 1**2 <= -1
Set bool_four to the result of 40 * 4 >= -4
Set bool_five to the result of 100 != 10**2'''




# Assign True or False as appropriate on the lines below!

# (20 - 10) > 15
bool_one = False    # We did this one for you!

# (10 + 17) == 3**16
# Remember that ** can be read as 'to the power of'. 3**16 is about 43 million.
bool_two = False

# 1**2 <= -1
bool_three = False

# 40 * 4 >= -4
bool_four = True

# 100 != 10**2
bool_five = False
