'''Comparisons result in either True or False, which are booleans as we learned before in this exercise.

# Make me true!
bool_one = 3 < 5
Let's switch it up: we'll give the boolean, and you'll write the expression, just like the example above.

Instructions
For each boolean value in the editor, write an expression that evaluates to that value.

Remember, comparators are: ==, !=, >, >=, <, and <=.

Use at least three different ones!

Don't just use True and False! That's cheating!'''



# Create comparative statements as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me true!
bool_one = 3 < 5  # We already did this one for you!

# Make me false!
bool_two = 5 < 3
 
# Make me true!
bool_three = 4<=(3+1)

# Make me false!
bool_four = 4<=(2+1)

# Make me true!
bool_five = 10 ==(5*2)
