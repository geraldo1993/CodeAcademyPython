'''Great work! We're almost done with boolean operators.

# Make me false
bool_one = (2 <= 2) and "Alpha" == "Bravo"
Instructions
This time we'll give the expected result, and you'll use some combination of boolean operators to achieve that result.

Remember, the boolean operators are and, or, and not. Use each one at least once!'''


# Use boolean expressions as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me false!
bool_one = (2 <= 2) and "Alpha" == "Bravo"  # We did this one for you!

# Make me true!
bool_two = 3==3 and 9>8     

# Make me false!
bool_three = not True and False

# Make me true!
bool_four = not False and True 

# Make me true!
bool_five = 0 or 1
